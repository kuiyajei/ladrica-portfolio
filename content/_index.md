Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.

I'm Jeri, fresh graduate (March 2023) from De La Salle - College of Saint Benilde with a degree in Information Systems (which is basically an IT with a flavour of entrepreneurship).

In here you'll find out more about me professionally and personally. 

Thanks for stopping by :)
