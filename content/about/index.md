### Who am I?

App development, video games, travel, fitness, Japanese entertainment, and learning the guitar. Messy list, but I never stuck to one thing. I like to think of myself as a master of none, and more of a jack-of-all-trades kind of guy.

Passionate in helping others, my only hope is to be able to improve the lives of others by sharing what I know.

### Graduation thoughts // Continuous growth

On the job training, leader of the capstone project's app development, and finishing another class... all in one term under 4 months. In the end, though, it all worked out. Never thought I'd appreciate an experience I hated so much. It was stressful, yet rewarding. Plenty of mixed feelings this one.

Now, after taking a such large step on my career, I find myself asking the same question as I once asked myself before: "what now?"

Honestly, I'm not so sure. Maybe I never will be.

But what I am sure of, is that the experiences I have endured for in the past 4 years were no mistake. I might not have an answer for that question right now, I might not be prepared for what's to come, I might not even be confident enough with the skills I've acquired in my education for the tougher roads ahead. But I do know that I'm still determined to see things through, to keep searching for that answer that comes back to me every time. And to me, that's absolutely fine, because there is no shame to keep on learning.
