### Who am I?

App development, video games, travel, fitness, Japanese entertainment, and learning the guitar. Messy list, but I never stick to one thing. I like to think of myself as a master of none, and more of a jack-of-all-trades kind of guy.

Passionate in helping others — my hope is to improve the lives of others by sharing what I know.

### Thoughts after graduation

After four months of what I'd describe as unforgiving, tough, and grueling — surprisingly it all worked out in the end. Taking the lead in two projects, developing and making changes to both of them, delegating tasks, and teaching my teammates, all under one term was nothing short of demanding. And yet still, it was all a very rewarding experience.

Hope that caught your attention because that's all I really have to say after four years of college :) I'd say those last four months of hard work were the most I got from my education. I'm not good at mixing words in a poetic fashion you see so I guess I'll just leave it at that. We'll just have to get to know each other better at an interview!
