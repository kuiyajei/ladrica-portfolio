### Who am I?

I'm bad at sentences so I'll just give you the gist of it. <br><br>

- Software Development
- Video Games
- Japanese entertainment
- Guitar
- Travel

...and a couple of other things I'm still exploring, but decided not to put on the list. Messy, I know, but I never stick to one thing. I like to think of myself as a master of none, and more of a jack-of-all-trades.

Committed to my work â€” my hope is to improve the lives of others by being of service and sharing what I know.
