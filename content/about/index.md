title: About Me
description: Hi, I'm Jericho Andrei Ladrica

App development, video games, travel, fitness, Japanese entertainment, and learning the guitar. Messy list, but I never stick to one thing. 

Passionate in helping others, my only hope is to be able to improve the lives of others by sharing what I know. That's pretty much it actually. Maybe some other time I'll put some pictures in this page if I actually have myself in them :laughing: (that I have confidence in sharing ofc... yes, I'm introverted)
